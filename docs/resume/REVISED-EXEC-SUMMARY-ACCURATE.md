# Revised Executive Summary & About Me (Accurate Timeline)

## 🎯 OPTION 1: Conservative & Accurate (Recommended)

### Executive Summary:
```
Data-Driven Product Leader—PLG/Consumer/SMB Expert. Turn user insights into growth through analytics, experimentation, and AI. Equally comfortable managing teams OR being hands-on IC.

Consumer product leader since 2013 across iconic brands: TurboTax ($900M, 4M+ users), Ancestry ($800M subscriptions), eBay (global marketplace). Now run SketchPop - CPO. Core superpower: data-driven decision making—analyze user behavior, run experiments, use insights to ship features that drive conversion and retention. Distinguished by shipping AI/ML products BEFORE ChatGPT hype, then rapidly adopting modern LLMs. Rare combination of:

• Data-Driven Decision Making: Analyze user behavior across millions of sessions, run A/B tests, use cohort analysis and funnel optimization to prioritize ruthlessly—my core superpower. Track record: +2% checkout conversion at eBay ($100M+ lift), 30% mobile conversion lift at Ancestry, 5% revenue lift from abandon cart
• Product-Led Growth: Led $900M PLG business at Intuit with zero sales team—freemium models, self-serve onboarding, conversion optimization. Also led growth initiatives at Ancestry ($800M subscriptions) and eBay marketplace
• Consumer/SMB at Scale: Served 4M+ solopreneurs at TurboTax, millions of consumers at Ancestry and eBay—understand consumer behavior, retention, engagement metrics deeply across multiple product types
• AI/ML for Growth: Shipped 4 AI products to reduce friction and drive conversion at Intuit (pre-ChatGPT), deployed modern LLMs at SketchPop (40% cost reduction)
• Multi-Scale Experience: $900M enterprise (Intuit) → $800M consumer subscriptions (Ancestry) → Global marketplace (eBay) → $3M SMB (SketchPop)

Seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies (Notion, Canva, Figma, Duolingo, Shopify) where data-driven decision making drives growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire—I thrive in both.

### About Me:
```
I'm a data-driven product leader who turns user insights into growth. Equally comfortable managing a team OR being the solo IC product hire. Consumer product leader since 2013 across TurboTax, Ancestry, eBay—deep AI/ML expertise, proven conversion optimization.

At Intuit, I led the $900M TurboTax Self-Employed business as Principal/Group PM serving 4M+ solopreneurs, freelancers, gig workers. Managed 4 PMs while staying hands-on—drove 10-15% CAGR ($100-150M annual growth) through data-driven decisions, A/B testing, and shipped 4 AI/ML products that reduced friction and improved conversion.

My superpower: using data analysis to make the right product calls. At TurboTax, analyzed user behavior across millions of sessions to identify drop-offs, then shipped AI features that increased completion rates. At Ancestry, led growth initiatives achieving 30% mobile conversion lift and 5% revenue boost from abandon cart. At eBay, drove $100M+ business lift through 2% checkout optimization. Pure PLG motion—no sales team, self-serve at scale.

As CPO of SketchPop ($3M consumer e-commerce, 20% margins), I wear many hats: solo product leader working with engineers, plus marketing, operations, finance. Acquired through Epilogue Capital (my investment firm focused on consumer/SMB businesses). Use AI as decision-making partner—design experiences, automate tasks, optimize funnels. I write specs, analyze data, work with engineers daily, ship fast.

I thrive in both leadership and IC roles. Led product teams at Intuit (4 PMs) and eBay (6+ analysts), now solo product leader at SketchPop—what matters is shipping great products and building great culture.

What I bring:
• Data-Driven Decision Making: Track record of conversion wins—+2% at eBay ($100M+), 30% at Ancestry, 5% revenue lift—my core superpower
• Product-Led Growth: Led PLG at scale (TurboTax $900M, Ancestry $800M, eBay marketplace)—freemium, self-serve, optimization
• AI/ML for Growth: Shipped 4 AI products at Intuit (pre-ChatGPT); use AI as force multiplier at SketchPop
• Consumer at Scale: Led products serving millions across TurboTax (4M+ users), Ancestry, eBay marketplace since 2013
• Hands-On Execution: Work with engineering, write specs, define requirements, ship products personally
• Team & Culture: Hire and scale PM teams (Intuit, eBay) while building great culture

Currently seeking: VP Product, Director Product, or Principal PM roles at PLG/consumer/SMB companies where data-driven decision making drives growth. Open to managing a team OR being solo IC hire—I thrive in both.

Ideal fit: PLG companies (Notion, Canva, Figma), consumer products (Duolingo, Grammarly), SMB tools (Shopify, Faire) building AI products. I work best where product leaders are hands-on, data-obsessed, culture matters.

Location: San Diego preferred, open to remote, willing to travel to LA/SF.
