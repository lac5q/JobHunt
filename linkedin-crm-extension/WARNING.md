# LinkedIn CRM Extension - Usage Warning

## Important: Use This Extension Sparingly

This Chrome extension reads data from LinkedIn pages to sync with your CRM. While convenient, **LinkedIn's Terms of Service prohibit scraping and automation tools**.

### Potential Risks

According to [LinkedIn's Prohibited Software Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1341387):

> LinkedIn doesn't permit the use of any third party software, including browser extensions that scrape or automate activity.

Consequences can include:
- Temporary account suspension
- "LinkedIn Jail" (view-only mode for weeks/months)
- Permanent account ban

### How to Minimize Risk

1. **Use sparingly** - Don't leave auto-sync running continuously
2. **Turn off when not needed** - Use the toggle in the extension popup
3. **Don't bulk scrape** - The extension is designed for occasional use
4. **Use official export too** - LinkedIn's data export is 100% safe

### Safer Alternative: LinkedIn Data Export

For bulk data, use LinkedIn's official export:

1. Go to **LinkedIn Settings** → **Data Privacy** → **Get a copy of your data**
2. Request your data (includes messages, connections, etc.)
3. Download the ZIP file when ready (usually within 24 hours)
4. Use the dashboard's **"Import LinkedIn Archive"** section

This official method is:
- ✅ 100% compliant with LinkedIn ToS
- ✅ No risk of account restriction
- ✅ Includes complete conversation history
- ✅ Includes all connection details

### When to Use the Extension

The extension is useful for:
- Quickly syncing a few recent conversations
- Keeping your CRM updated between official exports
- Capturing new messages since your last export

**Bottom line:** Use the extension occasionally for convenience, but rely on official exports for bulk data imports.
